IDEA: A classic question
      When trying to complete these types of questions we need to mentally take note of what we need to keep track of 
      In this case we need something to keep track of prev cur and next 

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *newhead = NULL;
        ListNode *cur = head;
        while(cur != NULL){
            ListNode *temp = cur->next;
            cur->next = newhead;
            newhead = cur;
            cur = temp;
        }
        return newhead;
    }
};
