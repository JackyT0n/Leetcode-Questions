Idea: we can use the convenient sorted function
      we can iterate through the array using a for loop
      the Keys will be the sorted version of the current word so that all words that are Anagrams will map to the same entry
      python has a unique way of adding to an entry
      d.get(key, []) + [w] is how we append it 
      
      Finally, python also allows you to return a dictionary's values in an array that DOES NOT map to keys 
      
class Solution:
   def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
    d = {}
    for w in (strs):
        key = tuple(sorted(w))
        d[key] = d.get(key, []) + [w]
    return d.values()
